                <p>What's up! My name is Alex Elkhatib.</p>
                <p>I am a twenty year old creative with a wide range of passions! I'm pursuing a career in Web Development to help others bring their ideas to life as well as sharpen my skills to build out my own ideas!</p>
                <p>While my next few months will be especially consumed by coding in this bootcamp, I keep myself very busy with other hobbies. I enjoy lifting weights, taking photos on my Sony A7SII, and playing video games to decompress.
                <p>Traveling is also a critical part of my life. Setting aside time throughout the year to explore the world and immerse myself in other cultures has and will continue to help me to understand and connect with all types of individuals I may meet.</p>
